# Async to Distributed: Concurrency Patterns for Data Processing

How to make your Python data workflows scale and run faster? We will explore builtâ€‘in `concurrent.futures` and `asyncio` patterns, and then show if and how to scale using frameworks like Dask or Ray. We will focus on practical recipes for CPU (or GPU) and memory demanding tasks, typical for data processing.

You will leave with a solid understanding of asynchronous code execution underpinnings. This talk will empower you to make informed practical decisions about applying concurrency in your data processing workflows.
